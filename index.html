    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    Some of the projects I have worked on include:
    <h4>Favourite Creature</h4>
    <p>
      In this project, I described a creature called the Phoenix. This was a mythical creature that had many origins and was believed to have magical powers. This creature was widely known for its rebirth from death as a new Phoenix was born out of the ashes of a dead Phoenix.
